On the course website you will find a link to a
software installation page with instructions that we kindly ask you to complete prior to the course:

If questions or problems arise please write to michael.schulte@unibe.ch


The course will be held in person in Uni Mittelstrasse, Room 320, Mittelstrasse 43, Bern.


Please complete all instructions prior to the start of the
