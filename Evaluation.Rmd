## How satisfied were you with the bootcamp in general? (5 points scale, 5 = best)

```{r}

    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 5.5)) +
      scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,10)) +
     geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),size=4) + 
    ylab('Count') + 
    theme_bw()
```


## Do you plan to rely on R in the future?

```{r}
